# June 4th: Start!

After some thinking for almost an hour, I decided to make my own timer/stopwatch thing. Calling it "Clook" because it sounds similar to "clock", but in a fun and unique way. 

Whipped out an online painting tool to flesh out my intial idea. Features I want to have are:
- USB C charging
- LED ring to show timer status and display things
- Screen to show exact time left (maybe touch screen?)
- Physical buttons to also interact with the device

You can see my very rough rendering below.
